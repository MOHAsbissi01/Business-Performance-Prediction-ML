# Business-Performance-Prediction-ML
Machine Learning project for business performance analysis and prediction — including regression, classification, customer segmentation, and recommendation systems using Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

# 🧠 Business Performance Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to analyze and predict **business performance** using real-world sales data.  
It covers supervised and unsupervised learning for **sales forecasting, profitability analysis, customer segmentation, and product recommendation**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

### 1️⃣ Prediction (Supervised Learning)
- **Predict future sales amounts** 💵  
  → Regression model based on Category, Sub-Category, Region, Discount, Quantity, and Segment.  
- **Predict order profitability** 📈  
  → Binary classification (Profitable vs Non-Profitable).  
- **Identify promo-dependent customers** 🎟️  
  → Analyze correlation between Discount and Sales.  
- **Predict purchase recency/frequency** 🔁  
  → Regression based on Order Dates for customer retention strategy.  

---

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Study the **impact of discounts** on profits 💰  
- Analyze **regional and segment performance** 🌍  
- Detect **seasonal patterns** in sales 📆  
- Evaluate **delivery delays vs. profitability** 🚚  
- Identify **top-performing products** 🏆  

---

### 3️⃣ Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised Learning)
- **RFM Segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary):**
  - Premium clients 💎
  - Loyal but low spenders 👕
  - At-risk clients ⚠️
- **Geographic and product-based segmentation** using K-Means and PCA.  

---

### 4️⃣ Product Recommendation (Collaborative Filtering)
- Suggest **complementary or similar products** 🛍️  
- Provide **seasonal recommendations** 🌸🍂  
- Offer **personalized suggestions** based on customer profile 👩‍🦱👨‍🦱  

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code  
- **Dataset:** Sales and order history data (CSV format)

---

## 📂 Structure
- data → datasets (cleaned + raw)
- notebooks → EDA, regression, classification, clustering, recommendation
- models → saved models (.pkl)
- visualizations → charts and figures
 

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add Power BI / Tableau dashboards  
- Integrate a simple Flask dashboard for model visualization  
- Deploy trained model on Streamlit
